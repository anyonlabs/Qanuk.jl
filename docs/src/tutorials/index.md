# Tutorial

If you want to know how Snowflake is used, this is the place to be. The tutorials are the best place to start if you are new to quantum computation. These tutorials take you step by step through Snowflake, gradually introduce concepts and assume no prior quantum computation knowledge. We recommend you work through these tutorials in order to get the most out of them.

## Basic Concepts
In this tutorial, we introduce basic concepts and objects that are used in Snowflake.

## Get QPU metadata

In this tutorial, we introduce the QPU interface and how to get the metadata of the machine.

Tutorial: [Get QPU metadata tutorial](./introductory/get_qpu_metadata.md)
Code: [tutorials/get\_qpu\_metadata.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/tutorials/get_qpu_metadata.jl)

### Single-qubit readout fidelity

In this tutorial, we cover the basics of initialization, readout, and readout fidelity.

Tutorial: [Single-qubit readout tutorial](./introductory/single_qubit_readout_fidelity.md)
Code: [tutorials/single\_qubit\_readout\_fidelity.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/tutorials/single_qubit_readout_fidelity.jl)

### Excitation demonstration

In this tutorial, we excite the qubit into state one.

### Hadamard transpilation

In this tutorial, we introduce the hadamard gate and circuit transpilation.

Tutorial: [Hadamard transpilation tutorial](./introductory/hadamard_transpilation.md)
Code: [tutorials/hadamard\_transplation.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/tutorials/hadamard_transpilation.jl)

### Entanglement demonstration

In this tutorial, we demonstrate entanglement by generating a Bell state.

Tutorial: [Entanglement demonstration tutorial](./introductory/entanglement_demonstration.md)
Code: [tutorials/entanglement\_demonstration.jl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/tutorials/entanglement_demonstration.jl)

### Asyncronous jobs

In this tutorial, we show how to run jobs asynchronously using Julia tasks.

Tutorial: [asynchronous jobs](./advanced/asynchronous_jobs.md)
Code: [tutorials/asynchronous\_jobsjl](https://github.com/anyonlabs/Snowflake.jl/blob/main/tutorials/asynchronous_jobs.jl)
